## App details

The application uses Identity user authentication to allow users to log in to the system. Once logged in, users can access various pages depending on their claims. Admins can create new communities and assign managers to them. They can also remove users from the system. Managers can view the details of the community they are assigned to, create new homes for that community, create new leases and link tenants to a lease. Tenants can only see the details of their lease and make payments.
